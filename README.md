# Instruction

This project contains both the frontend and backend, and due to the limitations of free hosting services like Heroku, Vercel, and Netlify, it's not feasible to host the entire project for free. To assist you in setting up and running the project on your local system, I have included in-depth videos and screenshots demonstrating all aspects of my work.
